	abstract = {We investigate the effect of surface termination on the charge state of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, which have been ion-implanted a few nanometers below the surface of diamond. We find that, when changing the surface termination from oxygen to hydrogen, previously stable NV− centers convert into NV0 and, subsequently, into an unknown nonfluorescent state. This effect is found to depend strongly on the implantation dose. Simulations of the electronic band structure confirm the disappearance of NV− in the vicinity of the hydrogen-terminated surface. The band bending, which induces a p-type surface conductive layer, leads to a depletion of electrons in the nitrogen-vacancies close to the surface. Therefore, hydrogen surface termination provides a chemical way to control the charge state of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Furthermore, it opens the way to electrostatic control of the charge state with the use of an external gate electrode.},

The oxidation process modified the surface including removal of non-diamond carbon and organic material which also led to a decrease in background fluorescence. During the course of the nanodiamond size reduction, we observed the annihilation of nitrogen-vacancy centres which provided important insight into the behaviour of colour centres in small crystals.

Moreover, UHV annealings of H-NDs after ageing in ambient air clearly underline that 75\% of the oxygen is related to physisorbed species. Finally, H-NDs were eﬃciently grafted using photochemical reaction with alkenes and a spontaneous coupling of aryldiazonium salts.

	abstract = {In this work we quantify and characterise the effects of air-oxidation on nitrogen-vacancy defect luminescence in both high-temperature-high-pressure and detonation synthesized nanodiamonds using Raman and luminescence spectroscopies. We find that oxidation treatments result in an increased nitrogen-vacancy centre excited state lifetime from 13 ns to 25 ns and in 5-nm diamonds the intensity of this luminescence increases by at least 5-fold. At the same time, in 5-nm diamonds, short lived surface-defect related luminescence is reduced by 10-fold. Furthermore we find that air oxidation reduces the sp2 and disordered carbon fraction of nanodiamonds by up to 5-fold in 5-nm nanodiamonds. Based on these results, the authors suggest that the disordered-carbon and graphite shell of 5-nm nanodiamonds quenches nitrogen-vacancy luminescence, and that this quenching can be partially reduced by surface oxidation. These findings provide useful insights into the role of the graphite and disordered carbon shell in quenching luminescence, and have implications for the applicability of 5-nm nanodiamonds to bio- and quantum physics applications.},

These are the lowest and the highest electron affinities, respectively, ever reported for any diamond surface. The variation in χ with O and H coverage is well described by a simple dipole model provided that the depolarization is properly taken into account for high adsorbate densities. This analysis favors the bridge position (etherlike) for oxygen on C(100). By mixing H and O adsorbates on a microscopic scale the EA of C(100) can be adjusted at will over 3 eV between the extreme values without jeopardizing the chemical passivation of the diamond surface afforded by H or O termination.},

	abstract = {We investigate the aerobic oxidation of high-pressure, high-temperature nanodiamonds (5?50 nm dimensions) using a combination of carbon and oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption, wavelength-dependent X-ray photoelectron, and vibrational spectroscopies. Oxidation at 575 °C for 2 h eliminates graphitic carbon contamination ({\textgreater}98\%) and produces nanocrystals with hydroxyl functionalized surfaces as well as a minor component ({\textless}5\%) of carboxylic anhydrides. The low graphitic carbon content and the high crystallinity of HPHT are evident from Raman spectra acquired using visible wavelength excitation (?excit = 633 nm) as well as carbon K-edge X-ray absorption spectra where the signature of a core?hole exciton is observed. Both spectroscopic features are similar to those of chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond but differ significantly from the spectra of detonation nanodiamond. The importance of these findings to the functionalization of nanodiamond surfaces for biological labeling applications is discussed.},

	abstract = {For the potential electronic applications of diamond as a wide band gap semiconductor, the properties of its surfaces are of fundamental importance. These properties in general depend on the kind of passivation of the surface dangling bonds, either by chemisorbed adsorbates or by the formation of mutual chemical bonds as a consequence of surface reconstruction. The principal crystallographic surfaces, (100), (111) and (110), are essentially understood in their adsorbate free form in terms of surface states and reconstructions. The corresponding results are briefly summarized in Section 2.

The consequences of adsorbate passivation are then discussed for the case of hydrogen as the most important radical for surface termination with emphasis on different aspects. Hydrogen passivation leads to a negative electron affinity due to a dipole layer which is induced by the heteropolar carbon–hydrogen bonds of the surface atoms. This aspect is discussed quantitatively in Section 3. Hydrogenation also reduces the amount of sp2 bonded carbon at the surface, which turns out to be the crucial parameter determining the position of the surface Fermi level and thus the surface band bending in diamond. This aspect is covered in Section 4. Finally, the combination of the electron affinity reduction by hydrogen and the supply of electrons at the Fermi level by sp2 bonded carbon phases has important consequences for the low threshold electron emission into vacuum. This is dealt with in the framework of an inhomogeneous emission model in Section 5. The model can be expected to be applicable for all system containing sp2 bonded or graphitic phases together with an sp3 bonded diamond matrix, especially for CVD diamond, and it should have important implications also for field emission from diamond films.},

	abstract = {We investigate band bending, electron affinity and work function of differently terminated, doped and oriented diamond surfaces by X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS). The diamond surfaces were polished by a hydrogen plasma treatment and present a mean roughness below 10 Å. The hydrogen-terminated diamond surfaces have negative electron affinity (NEA), whereas the hydrogen-free surfaces present positive electron affinity (PEA). The NEA peak is only observed for the boron-doped diamond (100)-(2×1):H surface, whereas it is not visible for the nitrogen-doped diamond (100)-(2×1):H surface due to strong upward band bending. For the boron-doped diamond (111)-(1×1):H surface, the NEA peak is also absent due to the conservation of the parallel wavevector component (k‖) in photoemission. Electron emission from energy levels below the conduction band minimum (CBM) up to the vacuum level Evac allowed the electron affinity to be measured quantitatively for PEA as well as for NEA. The emission from populated surface states forms a shoulder or a peak at lower kinetic energies, depending on the NEA behavior and additionally shows a dispersion behavior. The low boron-doped diamond (100)-(2×1):H surface presents a high-intensity NEA peak with a FWHM of 250 meV. Its cut-off is situated at a kinetic energy of 4.9 eV, whereas the upper limit of the vacuum level is situated at 3.9 eV, resulting in a NEA of at least −1.0 eV and a maximum work function of 3.9 eV. The high-boron-doped diamond (100) surface behaves similarly, showing that the NEA peak is present due to the downward band bending independent of the boron concentration. The nitrogen-doped (100)-(2×1):H surface shows a low NEA of −0.2 eV but no NEA peak due to the strong upward band bending. The (111)-(1×1):H surface does not show a NEA peak due to the k‖ conservation in photoemission; Evac is situated at 4.2 eV or below, resulting in a NEA of at least −0.9 eV and a maximum work function of 4.2 eV. The high-intensity NEA peak of boron-doped diamond seems to be due to the downward band bending together with the reduced work function because of hydrogen termination. Upon hydrogen desorption at higher annealing temperatures, the work function increases, and NEA disappears. For the nitrogen-doped diamond (100) surface, the work function behaves similarly, but the observation of a NEA peak is absent because of the surface barrier formed by the high upward band bending.},

	abstract = {The presence of large amounts of nondiamond carbon in detonation-synthesized nanodiamond (ND) severely limits applications of this exciting nanomaterial. We report on a simple and environmentally friendly route involving oxidation in air to selectively remove sp2-bonded carbon from ND. Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ Raman spectroscopy shows that sp2 and sp3 carbon species oxidize with different rates at 375−450 °C and reveals a narrow temperature range of 400−430 °C in which the oxidation of sp2-bonded carbon occurs with no or minimal loss of diamond. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy detects an increase of up to 2 orders of magnitude in the sp3/sp2 ratio after oxidation. The content of up to 96\% of sp3-bonded carbon in the oxidized samples is comparable to that found in microcrystalline diamond and is unprecedented for ND powders. Transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies show high purity 5-nm ND particles covered by oxygen-containing surface functional groups. The surface functionalization can be controlled by subsequent treatments (e.g., hydrogenization). In contrast to current purification techniques, the air oxidation process does not require the use of toxic or aggressive chemicals, catalysts, or inhibitors and opens avenues for numerous new applications of nanodiamond.},

The absorption and photoluminescence spectra have been investigated in the temperature range 1.8–77 K. A 12-line fine structure is observed close to 1.682 eV, and this can be divided into three similar groups each containing four components. The relative strengths of the optical absorption for the three groups of lines are found to be the same as the ratio of the abundancies of the natural isotopes of silicon, Si28, Si29, and Si30, thus showing that the 1.682-eV center is related to silicon impurity. The changes in the relative intensities of the four component lines associated with Si28 indicate that the center has two ground-state energy levels with a separation of 0.20 meV. The occupancies of the two excited-state levels of separation 1.07 meV tend to reach thermal equilibrium after optical excitation and before luminescence takes place. The relative transition probabilities for the transitions have been determined. The degeneracies of the ground-state levels are the same, and the degeneracies of the excited-state levels are also equal to one another. The behavior of the 1.682-eV defect after electron irradiation and subsequent heat treatment is described.},

However, the electronic structure of the defect, the nature of optical excitations and other related properties are not well understood. Here we present advanced ab initio study on SiV defect in diamond. We determine the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the nature of excitations of the defect.

We have measured an ensemble of silicon-vacancy centres across numerous nanodiamonds to have an inhomogeneous distribution of 1.05 nm at 5 K. Individual spectral lines as narrower than 360 MHz were measured in photoluminescence excitation, and correcting for apparent spectral diffusion yielded an homogeneous linewidth of about 200 MHz which is close to the lifetime limit.

	abstract = {With its host of outstanding material properties, single-crystal diamond is an attractive material for nanomechanical systems. Here, the mechanical resonance characteristics of freestanding, single-crystal diamond nanobeams fabricated by an angled-etching methodology are reported. Resonance frequencies displayed evidence of significant compressive stress in doubly clamped diamond nanobeams, while cantilever resonance modes followed the expected inverse-length-squared trend. Q-factors on the order of 104 were recorded in high vacuum. Results presented here represent initial groundwork for future diamond-based nanomechanical systems which may be applied in both classical and quantum applications.},

	abstract = {Realizing controlled quantum dynamics via the magnetic interactions between colour centres in diamond remains a challenge despite recent demonstrations for nanometre separated pairs. Here we propose to use the intrinsic acoustical phonons in diamond as a data bus for accomplishing this task. We show that for nanodiamonds the electron–phonon coupling can take significant values that together with mode frequencies in the THz range can serve as a resource for conditional gate operations. Based on these results, we analyse how to use this phonon-induced interaction for constructing quantum gates among the electron-spin triplet ground states, introducing the phonon dependence via Raman transitions. Combined with decoupling pulses this offers the possibility for creating entangled states within nanodiamonds on the scale of several tens of nanometres, a promising prerequisite for quantum sensing applications.},

	abstract = {Colour centres in diamond are promising candidates as a platform for quantum technologies and biomedical imaging based on spins and/or photons. Controlling the emission properties of colour centres in diamond is a key requirement for the development of efficient single-photon sources having high collection efficiency. A number of groups have achieved an enhancement in the emission rate over narrow wavelength ranges by coupling single emitters in nanodiamond crystals to resonant electromagnetic structures. In this paper, we characterize in detail the spontaneous emission rates of nitrogen-vacancy centres at various locations on a structured substrate. We found a factor of 1.5 average enhancement of the total emission rate when nanodiamonds are on an opal photonic crystal surface, and observed changes in the lifetime distribution. We present a model for explaining these observations and associate the lifetime properties with dipole orientation and polarization effects.},

	abstract = {Photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra, measured at varying temperatures and for different luminescent energies, are applied systematically to the study of defects in Ia, Ib, IIb, and chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) diamond. It is shown that the green luminescent band in CVD diamond films consists of two distinct components. The first one is attributed to recombination in the amorphous carbon phase. The second component increases with surface hydrogenation in CVD films, but an analogous band remains almost unchanged in Ib diamond. This band is ascribed to the donor-acceptor pair recombination. The photoionization threshold for transitions from the valence band to the donor level is determined as 3.25 eV. Based on PLE measurements the broad blue band is assigned to the vibronic band of a dislocation-related center with the ground state position in the range from EV to EV+0.37 eV. A series of undocumented photoluminescence (PL) lines at 1.81, 1.84, 1.91, 2.02, 2.1, and 2.2 eV is characterized by PL and PLE techniques as belonging to radiative transitions from different excited states to the same ground state of a divacancy-related center. Oscillatory behavior in the PLE spectra from CVD diamond is used to deduce EC−2.24 eV and EC−2.05 eV as the optical ionization thresholds to the conduction band for the divacancy-related and the 1.68 eV centers, respectively.},
