	abstract = {We investigate the effect of surface termination on the charge state of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, which have been ion-implanted a few nanometers below the surface of diamond. We find that, when changing the surface termination from oxygen to hydrogen, previously stable NV− centers convert into NV0 and, subsequently, into an unknown nonfluorescent state. This effect is found to depend strongly on the implantation dose. Simulations of the electronic band structure confirm the disappearance of NV− in the vicinity of the hydrogen-terminated surface. The band bending, which induces a p-type surface conductive layer, leads to a depletion of electrons in the nitrogen-vacancies close to the surface. Therefore, hydrogen surface termination provides a chemical way to control the charge state of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Furthermore, it opens the way to electrostatic control of the charge state with the use of an external gate electrode.},

The oxidation process modified the surface including removal of non-diamond carbon and organic material which also led to a decrease in background fluorescence. During the course of the nanodiamond size reduction, we observed the annihilation of nitrogen-vacancy centres which provided important insight into the behaviour of colour centres in small crystals. In these unirradiated samples, the smallest nanodiamond still hosting a stable nitrogen-vacancy centre observed was 8 nm.},

Moreover, UHV annealings of H-NDs after ageing in ambient air clearly underline that 75\% of the oxygen is related to physisorbed species. Finally, H-NDs were eﬃciently grafted using photochemical reaction with alkenes and a spontaneous coupling of aryldiazonium salts.

	abstract = {In this work we quantify and characterise the effects of air-oxidation on nitrogen-vacancy defect luminescence in both high-temperature-high-pressure and detonation synthesized nanodiamonds using Raman and luminescence spectroscopies. We find that oxidation treatments result in an increased nitrogen-vacancy centre excited state lifetime from 13 ns to 25 ns and in 5-nm diamonds the intensity of this luminescence increases by at least 5-fold. At the same time, in 5-nm diamonds, short lived surface-defect related luminescence is reduced by 10-fold. Furthermore we find that air oxidation reduces the sp2 and disordered carbon fraction of nanodiamonds by up to 5-fold in 5-nm nanodiamonds. Based on these results, the authors suggest that the disordered-carbon and graphite shell of 5-nm nanodiamonds quenches nitrogen-vacancy luminescence, and that this quenching can be partially reduced by surface oxidation. These findings provide useful insights into the role of the graphite and disordered carbon shell in quenching luminescence, and have implications for the applicability of 5-nm nanodiamonds to bio- and quantum physics applications.},

These are the lowest and the highest electron affinities, respectively, ever reported for any diamond surface. The variation in χ with O and H coverage is well described by a simple dipole model provided that the depolarization is properly taken into account for high adsorbate densities. This analysis favors the bridge position (etherlike) for oxygen on C(100). By mixing H and O adsorbates on a microscopic scale the EA of C(100) can be adjusted at will over 3 eV between the extreme values without jeopardizing the chemical passivation of the diamond surface afforded by H or O termination.},
