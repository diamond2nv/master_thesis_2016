\section[sample preparation]{sample preparation}
\subsection{preparation of the substrate}
\paragraph{IIa diamond as substrate}

Our choice of substrate is based on the principle of low background fluorescence, low refractive index and high thermal conductivity at low temperature (4K) and no misleading spectral features.

\paragraph{here is a paragraph dedicate to the expended explanation of requirements of substrate} 
\paragraph{here is a paragraph describing that based on the mentioned principles, Uwe Jantzen and coworkers has compared several different materials and in the end type IIa diamond rised as the most fitting candidate.}
\paragraph{FIB}
In order to make it more convenient to trace the nanodiamonds, markers were curved onto the surface of the IIa type diamond substrate, this work was done by Uwe Jantzen during his master's thesis period. As is shown in the fig.[], the focues ion beam bombards the surface of diamond away and leaves behind markers that are visible in optical microscopy images and SEM images, as well as confocal microscopy images.
\paragraph{here is a sketch of how Ga-ion bombards the surface of substrate}
\paragraph{here insert image of markers, optical, sem and confocal}

\subsection{spin-coating of the sample}
\subsubsection{theory of spin coating} 
Spin coating is the method that spreads the liquid evenly across the surface of 

thickness $\sim$ $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega}}$, time of evaporation, single time or multiple times. Surface condition and liquid spreading. Importance of clean room. Before and after optical image.
%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{Acid cleaning}
To make sure that the NDs dispension can evenly spread and eventually settled on the substrate, a smooth, cleaned and hydrophilic surface is important.

Tri acid boiling is a very practicle way of substrate cleaning.

\paragraph{here insert a sketch of how we do acid cleaning} 

the strongly acidic and oxidic mixture can remove most of the contaminations, leaving a clean hydrphilic surface covered with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups.

\section[development of a technology to estimate the spectral diffusion]{development of a technology to estimate the spectral diffusion}

\paragraph{Setup} 

In order to resolve the fine structure of ZPL of SiVs, we need to observe the sample at low temperature, thus a cryogenic setup must be applied.
Our setup is a typical confocal micropscopy setup connects with a cryostat, which cools the sample with liquid Helium flow.

\paragraph{here inserts a picture of our flow cryostat, from out and in side.}
This is the flow cryostat, whose main body is a vaccum chamber with

\paragraph{here insert a sketch of the cryo4 setup}
Confocal + Cryostat, Green laser + Red laser, spectrometer, apd, pic


\paragraph{PL} green laser + spectrometer. Instrumental limitation fo resolution from spectrometer. See the sum of all Emission over exposure time. Observing ZPL and phonon side band.

\paragraph{PLE} resonance excitation of optical transition. Rs√©solution limited by scanning step of laser. Observing phonon side band with apd. range of scanning: limited by laser, small.

\paragraph{time resolved PL spectra} Tracing PL spectra over time, show the diffusing behaviour of lines, characterisation methods: excitation polarisation: width of diffusion. Cross- correlation over time.
\paragraph{}We recorded and noticed that the diffusion, whose range can up to 1nm, is far beyond the capability of PLE.

\subsection[Second Oxidation]{second Oxidation}

\paragraph{method} According to [] paper, higher temperature - total removal of Sp2 carbon. Improvement of setup: to prevent contamination: cleaner tube, clean He flow when cooling. Improvement of characterisation: added in excitation polarisation, record the time resolved PL with 2 differently polarised incident beam. Samller nanodiamonds: a earlier batch.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Analysis} 
Comparasion if possible: different behaviour pre treatment between two batches
Possible reason: losing NDs due to Helium flow while cooling, GR1 getting closer to the surface due to oxidation caused size/thickness reduction.
